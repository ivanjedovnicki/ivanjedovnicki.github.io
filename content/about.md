Hi, my name is Ivan. I'm a physicist turned computer programmer who is currently
developing microservices for IOT devices using Python. Since I am intimately
familiar with how Python works under the hood, I am able to write code that's
kind to the hardware. I enjoy studying application and system design, so I try
to write code that's kind to the human reading it as well.
